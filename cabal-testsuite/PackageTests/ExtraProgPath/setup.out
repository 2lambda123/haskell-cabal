Resolving dependencies...
Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] next goal: CheckExtraProgPath (user goal)
[__0] rejecting: CheckExtraProgPath-0.1 (conflict: pkg-config package zlib-any, not found in the pkg-config database)
[__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: CheckExtraProgPath)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: CheckExtraProgPath (2)
